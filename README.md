# LoveNotes

What is LoveNotes❤️🎵?\
LoveNotes is a platform that allows users to share, rate, and discover new music. After creating an account, LoveNotes users can display their favorite songs on their profile for everyone to see, and rate tracks to share their music taste. Users can also search for their friends' accounts and discover just how similar their music taste is. More coming soon, stay tuned!🚀

Noteworthy Files🛠️:\
Public: folder of dependencies (just photos currently)\
index.html: HTML code for LoveNotes' landing page. This is the page users are greeted with upon visiting the website.\
Login.html: HTML code for LoveNotes' account page. This page will likely be dynamic and will show different content based on whether or not a user is logged into their account or not.\
Style.css: CSS code used to style the landing page (index.html), including the background colors, fonts, font sizes, and overall aesthetic.

**NOTE**: The sign-up and login buttons do not currently have any functionality (to be developed as project progresses).

How To Run💻:\
Currently, LoveNotes is not hosted on the internet. Thus, the code will have to be run locally in browser for the time being. This can be accomplished by going to the **Deployments** page and visiting our site from there, or alternatively just follow [this link](https://natelevinson10.github.io/COMP333_Project/).

Developers🧑‍🔬:\
Nate Levinson and Bella Tassone

HW1 participation📝: 50/50 split

**NOTE**: Bella's local git config wasn't synced up with her github account, and this was only noticed halfway through the project. As a result, the contributions look a little funky. If you look at the commits individually then everything is correct, but in the summaries (Pulse tab) it shows her total commits as two separate users, and additionally the Contributors tab doesn't show any of the commits that she made before syncing her local git config up to her github account.
