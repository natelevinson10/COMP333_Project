LoveNotes
Developers: Nate Levinson and Bella Tassone

What is LoveNotes?
LoveNotes is a platform that allows users to share, rate, and discover new music. After creating an account, LoveNotes users can display their favorite songs on their profile for everyone to see, and rate tracks to share their music taste. Users can also search for their friends' accounts and discover just how similar their music taste is. More coming soon, stay tuned!



How To Run:
Currently, LoveNotes is not hosted anywhere. Thus, the code will have to be run locally in browser for the time being.
